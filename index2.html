           <h2>You Always Be</h2>
           </div>
           <p>Today is rainy,Its seem the rain really understands about my heart.A heart who was broken because,he was go.To be honest is not a month since he was go,its been a two years since we broke up.He was happy with his new girlfriend,And i?Im still in love with him,fall in love alone,make friends with memories,I don’t know how to stop this feeling for him.I was do anything for trying to forgetting him.But,in the end,My love for him never be erased.I love him so much,I love him more than I love my self.I was trying to hating him,to let go,to forget,But I cant.I don’t know why.Maybe,when I said the first time to him that I love him,its not joke,it’s a true,because,until now,my love for him doesn’t change.
            Until in one night my handphones ringing,its mean theres someone that want to talk to me,What surprised I am,when I saw his name on my phones.To be honest,I want to talk to him,But,in the same side I cant talk with him,because,I don’t want to make this heart feel hurt again.He was send me a voice note.</p>
          <p>“Please,Answer my calling,Theres something that I want to talk to you.”
            After that my phone ringing again,and I answer that calling.
              “Mel?.”He said.
              ‘Why you call me?.”
              “I Miss you.”He said.
              Im speechless when he was said like that.I don’t know what to do,what to say.I miss him too,but I cant tell like this to him,Because,im afraid,im afraid that my love for him would be deeper than before.Remembering that he was having a new girlfriend.
              “Oh.”I said.
              “You don’t miss me,Like I miss you?.”
              “Little.”
              “You was forgetting me.”
              “You too,You was having a new girlfriend,But why?You called me and said you miss me?If your girlfriend know it will make her heart hurt.”
              “She wouldn’t know,That I calling you tonight.I Miss you so much,I was seeing our photos,and the things that you was gift to me.Its feel like I miss you so much,and I cant denied that I still have feelings to you.”
              “You not miss me,or still have a feelings to me,you just reminisce.”
              “No,Before I see our memories, there isn't a day that I pass without thinking about you,I Love You.”
              “Ok,But its wrong,you cant have a feelings for me,Don’t you remember?You was leave when I believe that you always want to stay.You tell me that im the most person that youre hate.And you say that im a bitch,I don’t deserve to be loved.”
              “Im Sorry,I have a mistake in the past,But,I want to changed it,if I can.”
              “Of course you can,You can fix it in your future with your new girl friend,But not with me.”
              “You hating me?.”
              “I cant hate you.”
              “So,Why?Why you don’t give me a chance to fixed anymore.”
              “Because,Past is past,we cannot fixed it,The things that you can do is learn from it.You can make your new relationship success,you can fix it with your new girl friend,But not with me.You just reminisce,You not love me anymore.I think its enough.I hope you can happy with your new girl friend.Bye.”
              Simple conversation,But make our memories back in my head,and make my heart feel hurts again,To be honest,Im still in love with him,and he still having a special places in my heart,and nobody can replaced it.I Know I m stupid to denied him to comeback with me,But,its better,than rather than forcing relationships that the universe never agreed to.I Love him so much,But,I cant against the destiny,I hope oneday if youre remember again about our love story,I just want to you know,that I will always love you,even untill the sun doesn’t have a light,even untill  the earth stop spinning,Im still loving you,no matter how hurt it is,I will do it again,and again.Because,our love story its my favorite.Because,You always be my owner of my heart.
